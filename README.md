# APIdouExamples

This repository contains a command-line tool to interact with [APIdou](www.apidou.fr).
It also contains some example codes to interact using different programming langages.

## Command-line tool
Python script which can redirect APIdou datas locally over TCP or a fake serial port (serial only working on Linux).

This code use the APIdou Python module, which can be found on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/apidou) or on its [GitHub Depot](https://github.com/iadjedj/apidou).

## Examples scripts :
* **Python** : Show how the APIdou module can be used alone

  * **Puredata** : Puredata lib for APIdou. Developed in collaboration with [L. Barnier](https://github.com/kouphrou)
  * **Processing**
  * **Unity**
 * **Scratch 2.0** : Uses a special command line tool which is included in this folder
